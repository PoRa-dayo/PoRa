	February 17th
	It’s been three years since my neighbor helped me defeat Mr. Zomboss guy on the roof, and so far there hasn’t been a zombie in sight. That Mr. Boss guy is probably up to something fishy, but that isn’t important. The real problem is, one day I woke up, and I suddenly realized that the only food at home was TACOS… EXCEPT FOR TACOS!
(Red letters: ↓ Tch, how embarrassing, do you people know how to write original content by themselves?)
The thought struck my brain like lightning. Yes! It’s time to hunt for food! I’m so hungry that I’m going crazy! The weather wasn't too bad, so I thought, why not take him on a month-long travel? I can’t just stay in my neighborhood forever. I’ll enjoy my life by traveling! Not only does healty travel let you see the beautiful scenaries, but I’ll also be able to live a “jumbo taco lifestyle”!
(Red letters: What’s with the spelling errors? And who in the world would want a “jumbo taco lifestyle”?)
Tacos or not, we must search for the most delicious food in the world!

	I tidied up the car I used to run the Twiddydinkles in, and went to where I usually put my car keys, but couldn't find them. Well, at least I’m 80% sure that someone stole it when I was kidnapped by that Bungee Zombie and faced Mr. Boss guy head on →_→
(Red letters: Why do I need these trash talks to guide me in this game anyway?
If I could I would’ve deleted both those two idiots. )	
Eh, forget it. I've already picked a forest in the east. It should fit nicely as the first stop on our trip. Wild fungus in the forest sure is gonna be crazy delicious! Yummy yummy!
(Red letters: ← Can these stupid game characters even consume the food textures?)

	Exploring the world is exciting, but the zombies are everywhere. I don’t know why, but they don’t seem that different from the zombies at home… eh, no time to care about all that, let's go deeper into the forest! I seem to have sensed the sweet aroma of fantastic Aipois!
	February 20th
	For the past two days I'm looking for aipois, which only exist in the forest, but then I stumbled upon a plant which I call the Pointichoke. It’s hard, and it has pointy leaves. I can’t be close to this at all, but seems like my neighbor is growing them as defensive plants... Wait, why am I trying to guide my neighbor here? It's not like he can read my diary. And it's totally fine even if I don’t write this, there's nothing he can't deal with.
(Red letters: Does this bunch of game characters really don’t know that the player outside can flip through these pages so casually?!)
	February 25th
	There’s a group of flying radishes deep in the forest which I now call Rotoradishes. That took me by surprise though. After all, I’ve never seen a flying plant before, so maybe there will be even more mind-exploding plants like floating peppers or flying turnips! Man, just imagine!
	March 10th
I was really confused. On the 20th of last month, I only said that Pointichokes were hard and I couldn’t be close to it, but I never mentioned that Pointichokes could harm zombies. But the neighbor was using the Pointichokes so flexibly as if he already knew how to use it from somewhere else.
But never mind all that. I care more about the cherry grove that is surrounded by Football Zombies. Those cherries are gonna be my next dish!
	March 11th
	The cherries there are very tasty. But compared with things happened later, the taste of these cherries fells less surprising. When I tried to eat them I was barely attacked by Football Zombies, and then cherry bombs just appeared and blew them into the sky. To be honest I forgot to bring them from your lawn, but they didn't mind and protected me from danger.
(Red letters: If you don't know how to explain why the cherry bomb appear then you can say nothing and just let the players get them, I mean why you fucking storyteller made up such a stupid story, is this outdated game not stupid enough?)
	March 12th
	Recently I’ve obtained a lotta new plants and made them into seed packets, but the zombies appear very densely today. I’ve never seen zombies coming In this fast before, but what surprised me even more was the neighbor being able to grow plants really quickly. Like as long as there’s sunlight, a bunch of plants would appear after a few seconds or so. But earlier there seemed to be something that preventing him from planting rapidly…
(Red letters: Didn't he know about the cooldown mechanism? I guess he didn’t.)
	And then again... why would I help you protect your brain? I barely even know who you are... I just somehow had an urge to help you grow plants and fight zombies.
	Neighbor… you can see me, right?
	March 21th
	It was really stupid to write those things in the diary on March 12th... My neighbor is my neighbor. It has been like this for so many years. Thinking like that isn’t gonna help.
Anyways, we arrived at a swamp, where not only there are many fireflies inside, there are also a lot of small mushrooms that look tasty. Maybe I can pick a few off and make mushroom soup.
(Red letters: Who wrote the plot for this game?
Are you really trying to turn a casual PvZ game into a freaking Sophie’s World? )
	March 22nd
	I ran into Mr. Boss guy today - oooh, my old nemesis. But something’s not right, Mr. Boss guy would usually just send letters to taunt us, but now he’s appearing in person?! He also talks and acts really weirdly... or, is this not the Mr. Boss guy I know at all?
Well, I shouldn't think too much. I told myself over and over again, just help the neighbors grow plants and fight zombies, same as always. But every time I think of my neighbor, I wanna know whom they truly are…
Maybe I’m just crazy.
	March 23rd
	I woke up in bed and everything in front of me was so... cartoonish? I thought I was dead and I was in heaven. But all this feels so real that I can even smell a little… disinfectant in the air? It wasn't until I accidentally glanced in the mirror that I realized I was Dave. And I then saw cards floating in the air, plants appeared inexplicably on the floor tiles…
So these are all dreams, right? Even the intense dizziness of being hit by a car, the freezing cold at the bottom of a lake, the pain of a shattered windshield passing through my skin and flesh... they all just feel like a dream, a very realistic one. When I woke up from this… “dream”, I would still be lying on the back seat of the car, my mother would still be looking at the scenery from the car window, my father still driving us around London on holiday... This nightmare will be over one day, and everything in this nightmare will soon be nothing but memories.
March 24th
	I don't know why, I always feel that something is staring at me. No matter where I am, what I am doing, it seems to be watching me, as if the eyes are from another dimension... This dream is too realistic. There are so few people here, I really wish I could wake up sooner.
	There is one more thing... This “Dr. Zomboss” I met today, he’s as annoying as my dad, and he talks like an underpaid actor. If this zombie scientist also appears in a certain game I play, I guess I’ll smash my keyboard.
	March 25th
	This is my third day here, and I still haven't woken up from my dream. Apart from those plants that appear out of nowhere whenever I see zombies, a panicked Zomboss and the cartoon visuals, everything else seems surprisingly real.
	I looked at the previous pages of this diary, and it seems like this body originally belonged to the real "Dave”. I guess I'd call him that. He also seems to be travelling, and his journey is almost exactly the same as mine at the beginning: starting from home, entering a forest, and passing through a swamp. I’m more convinced that this is all just a dream of mine…
	Oh, by the way, about the staring eyes I mentioned earlier, I think I found the reason - 90% chance it was just Scaredy-shroom’s doing... Whenever I didn’t pay attention, it peeked at me through the window, and whenever I checked on it, it shrank into the ground because of cowardice... I pulled it out and planted it somewhere else so that I don't feel uncomfortable.
	This dream has gone on long enough, I wish I could wake up soon.
	March 26th
	This is my fourth day in this dream, and I'm getting more and more anxious. That stupid stare is killing me. I really hope I wake up soon so that I can prove myself it's all just a bad dream...
	The realism here is terribly high, and a lot of things make me feel like I’m in a whole game world in its own right. Especially when Zomboss introduced me to the mechanism of the Conical Flask and the Laboratory in a serious manner, I was completely stunned.
	Dreams shouldn't be like this... I'm getting more and more scared. Maybe I'm really inside a game, and at this time there really is a player watching my every move from off-screen. And that would mean, everything before this was real... no, how could it be, I mean, a person falling into a lake, soaking for a while, and then entering another world? Come on now, this isn’t some sort of isekai story, is it?
	Soon, this big dream of mine won’t even exist, and when I wake up, everything in this dream is just a joke that no one will care about.
	March 27th
	There are a few Imps outside, but I don't want to think about it. Even if the zombies are approaching, the player off-screen will just plant plants to deal with them. So many things have happened recently, and my mind is a mess.
